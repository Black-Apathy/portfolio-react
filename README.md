💯 Excellent point, Deril — the current README is just the default boilerplate from the Vite template. It doesn’t reflect *your portfolio project at all*.

And you’re right — all that ESLint config stuff is not necessary to keep in a public-facing README, unless the repo is meant as a developer template.

Since this is **your portfolio site repo**, the README should:
✅ Explain what it is
✅ Show the live link
✅ Briefly mention the stack
✅ Optional: a screenshot or features list

### 📄 Here’s a good, minimal **README.md** for your repo:

```

### Why this is better:
✅ Clear and concise  
✅ Explains what the project is  
✅ Links to the live site  
✅ Mentions the stack and basic instructions  
✅ No irrelevant ESLint config noise

You can of course customize the tone — for example, you could add a fun tagline like:  
> *"My little corner of the web to showcase my work & tinkering spirit."*

If you’d like, I can even write a slightly more casual or a more professional variant for you. Let me know! 🚀
